## 👋 Welcome to SST Discussions!

We're using Discussions as a place to connect with other members of our community working with the SST (Sea Surface Temperature & ENSO Prediction) project. This is a teaching demo project that demonstrates machine learning workflows, and we welcome your participation!

### What you can do here:

- **Ask questions** about using the SST CLI, understanding the ML pipeline, or setting up your development environment
- **Share ideas** for improving the project, adding features, or enhancing workshop materials
- **Discuss teaching applications** - share how you're using SST in workshops or educational settings
- **Engage with the community** - help others, share your experiences, and collaborate on improvements
- **Propose enhancements** - suggest new features, documentation improvements, or workflow optimizations

### Getting Started

- **New to the project?** Check out our [README](README.md) for installation and usage instructions
- **Want to contribute?** See our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Developer section](README.md#developer) for setup and development workflows
- **Have a bug or feature request?** Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chicago-aiscience/workshop-sst/issues) for bug reports and feature requests
- **Questions about code?** Feel free to ask here in Discussions!

### Community Guidelines

We value respectful and inclusive interactions. Please:
- Be respectful and constructive in all discussions
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Search existing discussions before posting to avoid duplicates
- Provide context when asking questions (what you've tried, what you're trying to achieve)
- Help others when you can - we're all learning together!

### Project Focus

SST is designed as a teaching demo emphasizing:
- Repeatable ML pipelines for Sea Surface Temperature and ENSO prediction
- Best practices in testing, documentation, and CI/CD
- Clear examples for workshop audiences
- Educational value for learning ML workflows

We welcome suggestions that improve clarity for workshop audiences and help others learn!
